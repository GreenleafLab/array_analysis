Series	ConstructType	Descriptor	Rationale
WatsonCrick	WC_5ntstem, WC_6ntstem, WC_7ntstem	enumerates over all possible watson-crick pairs in stem length 5 in WC1 series. In WC2 has same stem with a single GC stack added to the base of the stem. WC3 has a single GC stack added to the base of the loop	to have each WC pair in many different contexts. The additional GC stacks are added in case some of the constructs do not fall within the sweet spot (are too unstable)
TRIloop	NN, NNN	enumerates over all possible triloops with all possible stacks of length 1 and 2 at the base of the loop. 2 different scaffolds are used	for deriving nearest neighbor parameters of triloops and two scaffolds are used to help ensure the stem is in the sweet spot at least once.
TETRAloop	NN, NNN	enumerates over all possible tetraloops with all possible stacks of length 1 and 2 at the base of the loop. 2 different scaffolds are used	for deriving next nearest neighbor parameters of triloops. Only one scaffold is used due to space limitations
VARloop	VariableLoops	a series of constructs where there is a constant GC rich stem and variable loop region that is the form Gan	sort of a sanity check to see if fluor-quench behavior is behaving as expected as a function of distance
Bulges	NN_5primebulge, NN_3primebulge	enumerates over all possible bulges with all possible stacks of length 1 at the base of the loop. 2 different scaffolds are used	for deriving nearest neighbor parameters of tetraloops and two scaffolds are used to help ensure the stem is in the sweet spot at least once.
Bulges	NNN_5primebulge, NNN_3primebulge	enumerates over all possilbe bulges with all possible stacks of length 2 at the base of the loop, 1 scaffold is used.	for deriving next nearest neighbor parameters of tetraloops. Only one scaffold is used due to space limitations
MisMatches	AC_mismatch_varpos	"a series of mismatches where the variable region is of length 5 and < 2 AC or CA mismatches may occur anywhere in the stem. The top and bottom of the stem has a GC added for stability "	for deriving nearest neighbor parameters of triloops and two bulges are used to help ensure the stem is in the sweet spot at least once.
MisMatches	GT_mismatch_varpos	"a series of mismatches where the variable region is of length 5 and < 2 GT or TG mismatches may occur anywhere in the stem. The top and bottom of the stem has a GC added for stability "	for deriving next nearest neighbor parameters of bulges. Only one scaffold is used due to space limitations
MisMatches	Centered	"enumerates over all possible 1 and 2 mismatches within a all possible variable stems of length 3. Adds a stabilizing GC scaffold at the base of the stem. "	AC at all possible positions of all possible sequences of length 5 with no more than 2 AC mismatches per construct. Used to get many different contexts for AC mismatch
MisMatches	3mer	"enumerates over all mismatches in a 3 mer where the mismatch can be in any position within that 3mer. "	GT at all possible positions of all possible sequences of length 5 with no more than 2 GT mismatches per construct. Used to get many different contexts for GT mismatch
Control	RepeatControls	"a series of different short motifs are used to make various repeat polymers of the max length. These are mostly AT rich by design and some GA, CT repeats. Avoids GGGG. "	
Control	PolyNTControls	"a series of constructs  of increasing length from 1 to max length with polyA or polyT "	used as negative controls (should always be maximally far apart). Have a few different sequences because we noticed polyA and polyT behave differently so thought using a bunch would work best)
Control	StemDangle_3p, StemDangle_53p, StemDangle_5p	a series of control stems that are constant GC rich stems with high Tms and varying lengths of polyA on the 5' or 3' end	"for validation purposes. "
Control	SuperStem	a set of 5 GC rich stems of the maximum length possible for use as a negative control	more important for RNA but used as orthogonal controls since they also measure thermodynamics of these structures
External	pseudoknots	a series of fun constructs that are pseudoknots that have mutations to disrupt specific stems one at a time by replacing with polyA of the same length as the stem	looking at the effects of increasing variable loops though I don't think this is entirely useful its kind of interesting - tends to have non-two state behavior
External	WBcontrols	controls taken from Winston's original pilot run	some fun constructs hannah wanted to test. These are pseudoknots that have been annotated in the RNA world but not the DNA world so not sure its important for our purposes right now
External	PUMcontrols	a set of controls taken from Inga and Winston's paper measuring Pumillo RBP binding to RNA secondary structure	sanity checks to see if we are getting something similar to him
External	BaeControls	"constructs of mismatch controls from Bae et al. which measured a few mismatches with very low error using toeholds "	a very strong GC rich stem that is used as a control. Should melt at very high temp.
